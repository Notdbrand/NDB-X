# NDB-X
The source code for my tweak that allows you to change the URLs of the weather and stocks app to any URL you want.

The URLs can be changed in the setting app and it defaults to my server.

Only tested on an iPhone 5 on ios 6.1.4, but it probably works on all ios 6. I do some more testing soon.

Known bugs:
Weather widget doesn't work yet.
